# Project Pizza

Replace this readme with your own information about your project. Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

The assignment was to practise using variables and conditionals and get an understanding of how they work together.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I used the guidelines from the previous classes(with the concert and artists exercise) and adjusted it to the assignment. I also got some help from ChatGPT when I got stuck with a small error in my code.
